## Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m a seasoned full-stack engineer at Shopify, where I deliver software to millions of merchants worldwide.

🛠️ I write Typescript and Ruby at work using React, Next.js, and Ruby on Rails.

📱 I also have experience with mobile technologies such as Swift, SwiftUI, and Objective-C and have built several native iOS apps.

🌱 I’m currently expanding my skill set by delving into systems programming with Rust 🦀.
