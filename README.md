## Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m a seasoned full-stack engineer at Shopify, where I architect and deliver high-performing, scalable software at global scale to millions of merchants worldwide.

🛠️ I have a strong command of modern web technologies, including Typescript, React, and Ruby. I also have a deep understanding of distributed systems, API design, and scalable frontend architectures.

🌱 I’m currently expanding my skill set by delving into systems programming with Rust 🦀 and Zig.
